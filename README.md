Each character represents a different set of questions.

Those questions would load sequence triggered, availble Options like so:

1)These set of questions have their own set of menus.

2)Then each set of menus have their own  submenus.

Think of it this way:

Available Optionss:

1)You access Exier Through King
2)You access Archers through Exier
3)You access Jarvis throu Archers
4)Kinda like a relay..

Why, you ask?

We feel It should be a challenge to access some of the tools included in this operating system.

"We feel the people who don't see how far the rabbit hole goes, shouldn't play with some of the tools included in this operating system." - Turncloak-Exile.com
