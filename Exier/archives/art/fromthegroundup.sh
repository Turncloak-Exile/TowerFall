echo Jarvis is the Arc reactor of Towerfall.
sleep 1
echo Jarvis has a power level of over 9000.
sleep 1
echo Jarvis was the first script based multiple choice system Exier wrote.
sleep 1
echo Exier wanted to split Jarvis into different versions.
sleep 1
echo Then the Jarvis family was born.
sleep 1
echo Shortly after Exier wrote JarvisC, JarvisG, JarvisI etc. Another ambitious idea arose.
sleep 1
echo Towerfall operating system was born.
sleep 1
echo With all these Jarviss running around willy nilly someone had to take control.
sleep 1
echo Then the Archers where born.
sleep 1
echo The Archers consist of a family of four and each Archer is a Gate Keeper for a special collection of files.
sleep 1
echo These files are split into four catagories; Quests, Archives, Vs and Options. 1 Archer controlls 1 catagory.
sleep 1
echo Whilst writing the code for the Archers something had to be done about the mess they had produced.
sleep 1
echo Then Exier was virtualised into its own manager.
sleep 1 
echo Exier is the name given to the producers of Towerfall Operating System.
sleep 1
echo So by now you would have thought we would have had enough of all these menus but last but not least,
sleep 1
echo The King was born.
sleep 1
echo With motivation from the Towerfall Acension PS4 Exclusive game. We wanted to create a game/operating system that
echo can either be launched by the command line or GUI interface (Gui still in production)
sleep 3
echo The King dominates Towerfall the game by transforming into a dragons head on all the hard levels. 
echo This dragons head is the last boss to beat on the game. Causing friendships to be tested and controllers being 
echo squeezed to death.
sleep 3
echo We thought The king should boot up the Towerfall Operating System, we think users will soon realise the connection and
echo appreciate the thought that has been put into this operating system abit more than they thought.
sleep 2
echo We shout out to the developers of the Towerfall Ascension PS4 game as we got all our inspiration from them.
echo Exier is looking forward for Underworld patch/update. Who knows..there might even be a Towerfall operating system 
echo patch released shortly after..
sleep 2
echo Ancient Exile and Turncloak Solider hope you enjoy Towerfall operating system
