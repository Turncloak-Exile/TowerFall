If you find this hard to get your head around. Don't worry, we've made TowerFall as simple and quick as possible, by using multiple choice questions to get to where you need as fast as possible.

Why do it like this? you ask?

Here at Exier, we feel It should be a challenge to use some of the tools included in this operating system. As with great power comes great responsibility.

"We feel the people who don't want to jump down the rabbit hole, shouldn't use this operating system." - Ancient Exile Turncloak-Exile.com
